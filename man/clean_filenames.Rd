\usage{
clean_filenames(filenames)

\arguments{
\item{filenames}{A character vector of file paths or basenames.}
}
\value{
A character vector of cleaned filenames (same length as
input). Directory paths are preserved if provided.
}
\description{
Cleans a vector of filenames by removing common standalone numbers
that appear in more than half of the filenames, condensing multiple
separators, and removing leading/trailing separators. This is a
pure string operation — no files are renamed on disk.
}
