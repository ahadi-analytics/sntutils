\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing health facility data.}

\item{vars_of_interest}{Character vector of variable names to assess
reporting (used for numerator).}

\item{x_var}{Character. Name of the primary grouping variable (e.g., time
period).}

\item{y_var}{Character. Optional. Name of the second grouping variable
(e.g., district).}

\item{hf_col}{Character. Optional (defaults to NULL). Name of the column
containing unique health facility IDs. When provided, enables facility-level
analysis and filtering of inactive facilities (if key_indicators are specified).
Can be used with or without y_var. Required when weighting = TRUE.}

\item{key_indicators}{Optional. Character vector of indicators used to define
facility activity in scenario 1. Defaults to
\code{c("allout", "conf", "test", "treat", "pres")}.}

\item{method}{Character or numeric. Classification method for facility activity
status. Can be numeric (1, 2, 3) or character ("method1", "method2", "method3").
Defaults to 3. See \code{\link{classify_facility_activity}} for details.}

\item{nonreport_window}{Integer. Minimum number of consecutive non-reporting
months to classify a facility as inactive in method 3. Defaults to 6.}

\item{reporting_rule}{Character. Defines what counts as reporting:
\code{"any_non_na"} (default, counts NA as non-reporting, 0 counts as reported)
or \code{"positive_only"} (requires >0 value to count as reported).}

\item{require_all}{Logical. When TRUE and multiple vars_of_interest are
provided, calculates the proportion of facilities reporting ALL variables
(complete data). When FALSE (default), calculates per-variable reporting
rates. Only applies to facility-level analysis (when hf_col is provided).}

\item{weighting}{Logical. Whether to use weighted reporting rates. When TRUE,
facilities are weighted by their typical size, giving more importance to
larger facilities in the overall reporting rate calculation. This provides
a volume-adjusted measure of data completeness. Default is FALSE.}

\item{weight_var}{Character. Name of the variable to use as proxy for
facility size (e.g., "allout" for total outpatients, "test" for tests done).
This should be a count variable that reflects facility activity/size.
If NULL and weighting is TRUE, will auto-select from allout, test, conf
(in that order).}

\item{weight_window}{Integer. Number of periods for rolling window to
calculate typical facility size. A facility's weight is based on its
average size over the past weight_window periods. Larger windows provide
more stable weights but may miss recent changes. Default is 12.}

\item{exclude_current_x}{Logical. Whether to exclude current period when
calculating weights. If TRUE, prevents current reporting from influencing
its own weight (avoids circularity). Default is TRUE.}

\item{cold_start}{Character. Method for handling facilities with insufficient
history (< weight_window periods). Options:
\itemize{
\item "median_within_y" (default): Uses median size of facilities within the
same y_var group (e.g., same district)
\item "median_global": Uses median size across all facilities
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with the number of reporting (\code{rep}) and expected (\code{exp})
facilities or records, and the computed \code{reprate} and \code{missrate}.

\strong{Understanding the metrics:}
\itemize{
\item \code{exp} (expected): When \code{hf_col} is provided with \code{key_indicators}, this is
the count of ACTIVE facilities only. Without \code{hf_col}, it's the count of
all data rows (including inactive facilities).
\item \code{rep} (reported): Count of facilities/rows that reported (non-NA values).
\item \code{reprate}: Reporting rate (rep/exp). With proper facility identification,
this is the percentage of ACTIVE facilities that reported.
\item \code{missrate}: Missing rate (1 - reprate). With proper facility identification,
this is the percentage of ACTIVE facilities that failed to report.
\strong{Without \code{hf_col}, this may be artificially high due to inactive facilities.}
}

If weighting is TRUE, additional columns are included:
\itemize{
\item \code{reprate_w}: Weighted reporting rate (0-1)
\item \code{missrate_w}: Weighted missing rate (0-1)
\item \verb{avg_<weight_var>}: Average raw value of the weight variable (e.g., avg_allout)
\item \verb{min_<weight_var>}: Minimum raw value of the weight variable
\item \verb{max_<weight_var>}: Maximum raw value of the weight variable
}
}
\description{
This function calculates reporting metrics for health facility data across
three common scenarios. \strong{IMPORTANT}: When facility identification (\code{hf_col})
and \code{key_indicators} are provided, the function excludes inactive facilities
from denominators, ensuring that missing rates reflect only the proportion
of ACTIVE facilities that failed to report, not all facilities in the dataset.
}
\details{
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Proportion of facilities reporting a single variable}
\itemize{
\item When \code{vars_of_interest} contains a single variable:
\item Calculates the proportion of active facilities (as defined by reporting
on \code{key_indicators}) that reported the variable in a given period.
\item Requires \code{hf_col}. Can be used with or without \code{y_var}.
}
\item \strong{Per-variable facility reporting rates}
\itemize{
\item When \code{vars_of_interest} contains multiple variables and \code{hf_col} is provided:
\item Calculates reporting/missing rates for EACH variable separately, counting
distinct facilities that reported each specific variable.
\item Uses facility-level analysis, filtering to active facilities only
(if \code{key_indicators} specified).
\item Can be used with or without \code{y_var}.
}
\item \strong{Row-level reporting rates (without facility filtering)}
\itemize{
\item When \code{hf_col} is NOT provided:
\item Computes reporting/missing rates based on data rows, not facilities.
\item \strong{WARNING}: This counts all data rows including inactive facilities,
potentially inflating missing rates.
\item Use scenarios 1 or 2 (with \code{hf_col}) for accurate facility-based metrics.
}
}
\subsection{Weighted Reporting Rate Calculation}{

When \code{weighting = TRUE}, the function calculates volume-adjusted reporting
rates that give more importance to larger facilities. This is useful when
you want the overall reporting rate to reflect the proportion of patient
visits or services covered rather than just the proportion of facilities.

The weighting algorithm works as follows:
\enumerate{
\item \strong{Calculate typical facility size}: For each facility, compute the
rolling mean of \code{weight_var} over the past \code{weight_window} periods.
This represents the facility's typical size/volume.
\item \strong{Handle cold starts}: For facilities with insufficient history:
\itemize{
\item If \code{cold_start = "median_within_y"}: Use the median typical size
of facilities in the same group (y_var)
\item If \code{cold_start = "median_global"}: Use the overall median typical size
}
\item \strong{Normalize weights}: Within each time period and group, weights are
normalized to sum to 1. This ensures that larger facilities get
proportionally more weight.
\item \strong{Calculate weighted rates}:
\itemize{
\item \code{reprate_w = sum(weight * reported) / sum(weight)}
\item \code{missrate_w = 1 - reprate_w}
}
}
}

\subsection{Example Interpretation}{

If a district has 10 facilities where:
\itemize{
\item 3 large facilities (80\% of patient volume) all report
\item 7 small facilities (20\% of patient volume) with only 4 reporting
}

Then:
\itemize{
\item Unweighted reporting rate = 7/10 = 70\%
\item Weighted reporting rate \\u2248 84\% (reflecting that most patient volume is covered)
}
}
}
