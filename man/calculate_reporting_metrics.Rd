\title{Calculate reporting/missing rate and proportion of reporting facilities}
\usage{
calculate_reporting_metrics(
  data,
  vars_of_interest,
  x_var,
  y_var = NULL,
  hf_col = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing health facility data}

\item{vars_of_interest}{Character vector of variable names to assess
reporting.}

\item{x_var}{Character. Name of first grouping variable (e.g. time period)}

\item{y_var}{Character. Name of second grouping variable (e.g. district);
can be NULL}

\item{hf_col}{Character. Name of column containing unique health facility
IDs; required only for facility-level}
}
\value{
A tibble with calculated rates depending on Scenario
}
\description{
This function calculates reporting metrics for health facility data:
\enumerate{
\item Scenario 1: reporting rate by (x_var, y_var) â€” how often values appear in
a group (all vars_of_interest)
\item Scenario 2: reporting rate of variables over time (x_var only)
\item Scenario 3: proportion of health facilities in y_var that reported any
value
}
}
\details{
Note: All Scenarios treat 0 values as NA to ensure consistent reporting
metrics
}
