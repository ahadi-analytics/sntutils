\title{Download WHO Administrative Boundaries with Partial Update}
\usage{
download_shapefile(
  country_codes,
  admin_level = "ADM2",
  latest = TRUE,
  dest_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{country_codes}{Character vector of ISO3 country codes
(e.g. c("KEN","UGA")).}

\item{admin_level}{Character string specifying administrative level
("ADM0", "ADM1", or "ADM2"). Default is "ADM2".}

\item{latest}{Logical. If TRUE (default), returns only the latest/active
boundaries. If FALSE, returns all historical boundaries.}

\item{dest_path}{File path where data is saved. If NULL (default),
data is returned without saving to disk. When \code{latest = TRUE}, the output
filename will include the suffix \verb{_latest} before the extension.}
}
\value{
An \code{sf} object containing administrative boundaries with the
following columns:
\describe{
\item{adm0_code}{ISO3 country code}
\item{adm0}{Country name}
\item{adm1}{Admin level 1 name (regions/states) - only for ADM1 and ADM2}
\item{adm2}{Admin level 2 name (districts) - only for ADM2}
\item{start_date}{Date when the boundary became effective}
\item{end_date}{Date when the boundary ceased (9999-12-31 for current)}
\item{geometry}{Spatial geometry column}
}
If \code{dest_path} is provided, the data is also saved to that location.
}
\description{
Downloads administrative boundaries from WHO's ArcGIS services for specified
countries and administrative levels. The function supports incremental
updates, downloading only missing data when appending to existing files. It
automatically converts date fields from milliseconds to proper Date format
and can filter for current boundaries or include historical boundaries.
}
\details{
The function retrieves boundary data from WHO's Global Administrative
Boundaries service hosted on ArcGIS. It uses the httr2 package for API
requests and sf for spatial data handling. Date fields are automatically
converted from milliseconds since epoch to R Date objects.

When \code{latest = TRUE} (default), only active boundaries are returned (those
with ENDDATE of 9999-12-31). When \code{latest = FALSE}, all historical boundaries
are included, useful for tracking boundary changes over time (e.g., country
splits or administrative reorganizations).

The incremental update feature checks existing files for already downloaded
countries and only fetches missing ones, making it efficient for building
large boundary datasets.

\note{
Requires the \code{httr2} package for API requests. Install with:
\code{install.packages("httr2")}
}

\dontrun{

# Download latest ADM2 boundaries without saving to disk
kenya_districts <- download_shapefile(

  latest = FALSE  # Include historical boundaries
)
# This would show Sudan before and after South Sudan independence
# (2011-07-11)

# Download multiple countries and save to directory
# File will be saved as "who_shapefile_ken_uga_tza_adm0_latest.gpkg" (latest=TRUE)
africa_countries <- download_shapefile(
  country_codes = c("KEN", "UGA", "TZA"),
  admin_level = "ADM0",

# Incremental update - add more countries to existing file
# Will automatically use the same filename for the same countries+admin combo
download_shapefile(
  country_codes = c("KEN", "UGA", "TZA", "RWA", "BDI"),
  admin_level = "ADM0",
  dest_path = tf
)
# Creates "who_shapefile_ken_uga_tza_rwa_bdi_adm0_latest.gpkg" (latest=TRUE)

# Different admin levels saved to different files automatically
# Saves as "who_shapefile_ken_adm1_latest.gpkg" (latest=TRUE)
download_shapefile("KEN", "ADM1", dest_path = tf)

# Saves as "who_shapefile_ken_adm2_latest.gpkg" (latest=TRUE)
download_shapefile("KEN", "ADM2", dest_path = tf)

# Multiple countries at ADM2 level
# Saves as "who_shapefile_com_syc_mus_adm2_latest.gpkg" (latest=TRUE)
