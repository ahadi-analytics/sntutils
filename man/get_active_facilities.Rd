\usage{
get_active_facilities(
  data,
  hf_col,
  date_col = "date",
  key_indicators = c("allout", "conf", "test", "treat", "pres"),
  method = 3,
  nonreport_window = 6,
  reporting_rule = "any_non_na",
  return_summary = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing health facility data}

\item{hf_col}{Character. Name of the column containing unique facility IDs}

\item{date_col}{Character. Name of the date column. Default is "date"}

\item{key_indicators}{Character vector of indicator columns used to determine
reporting activity. Default is c("allout", "conf", "test", "treat", "pres")}

\item{method}{Numeric or character. Classification method (1, 2, 3, "method1",
"method2", "method3"). Default is 3 (dynamic activation/inactivation)}

\item{nonreport_window}{Integer. Number of consecutive non-reporting periods
before a facility is considered inactive (for method 3). Default is 6}

\item{reporting_rule}{Character. What counts as reporting: "any_non_na"
(default, 0 counts as reported) or "positive_only" (requires >0)}

\item{return_summary}{Logical. If TRUE, returns a summary tibble instead of
filtered data. Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
If \code{return_summary = FALSE} (default): Returns the input data frame
filtered to include only rows for active facilities, with an added
\code{activity_status} column.

If \code{return_summary = TRUE}: Returns a summary tibble with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{n_total}: Total number of unique facilities
\item \code{n_active}: Number of active facilities
\item \code{n_inactive}: Number of inactive facilities
\item \code{pct_active}: Percentage of facilities that are active
\item \code{pct_inactive}: Percentage of facilities that are inactive
}
}
\description{
This helper function identifies and returns only active facilities from a
dataset based on their reporting patterns. It's a convenience wrapper around
\code{\link{classify_facility_activity}} that filters the data to include
only facilities classified as "Active".
}
\details{
This function is particularly useful for:
\itemize{
\item Pre-filtering data before calculating reporting rates
\item Understanding the proportion of operational facilities
\item Ensuring denominators only include facilities that should be reporting
}

The function uses \code{\link{classify_facility_activity}} internally to
determine facility status based on reporting patterns in the key indicators.
