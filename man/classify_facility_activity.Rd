\usage{
classify_facility_activity(
  data,
  hf_col,
  date_col = "date",
  key_indicators = c("test", "pres", "conf")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing routine health facility records.}

\item{hf_col}{Character. Column storing health facility identifiers.}

\item{date_col}{Character. Column storing observation dates. Defaults to
"date".}

\item{key_indicators}{Character vector with columns defining reporting
activity. Defaults to \code{c("test", "pres", "conf")}.}
}
\value{
Data frame with original columns plus:
\describe{
\item{reported_any}{Logical. TRUE if any key indicator was reported
that month.}
\item{first_reporting_date}{Date. First month the facility reported
any key indicator.}
\item{has_ever_reported}{Logical. TRUE if facility has reported at
least once up to this month.}
\item{activity_status}{Factor. One of "Active Reporting",
"Active Facility - Not Reporting", or "Inactive Facility".}
}
}
\description{
Builds a balanced monthly panel for all facilities and months, flags
reporting on key indicators, and classifies each facility-month into an
activity status: "Active Reporting", "Active Facility - Not Reporting",
or "Inactive Facility".
}
\details{
Activity status logic:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Active Reporting}: Facility reported at least one key indicator
in that month.
\item \strong{Active Facility - Not Reporting}: Facility has reported before
but did not report in that month.
\item \strong{Inactive Facility}: Facility has never reported any key indicator.
