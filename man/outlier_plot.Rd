\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame containing the indicator to analyse.}

\item{column}{Name of the numeric column to evaluate.}

\item{record_id}{Unique record identifier column.}

\item{admin_level}{Character vector of administrative level columns for
parallel grouping, ordered from higher to lower resolution.
Defaults to \code{c("adm1", "adm2")}.}

\item{spatial_level}{Character string specifying the finest spatial unit
for analysis (e.g., "hf_uid" for facility-level). When specified,
\code{admin_level} defines grouping boundaries while \code{spatial_level} defines
the unit of analysis. This prevents excessive grouping while maintaining
spatial granularity. Default is \code{hf_uid}.}

\item{date}{Date column (Date, POSIXt, or parseable character string).
Year, month, and yearmon are automatically derived from this column.}

\item{time_mode}{Pooling strategy: \code{"across_time"} or \code{"within_year"}.}

\item{value_type}{Indicator type: \code{"count"} or \code{"rate"}. Counts floor lower
bounds at 0.}

\item{strictness}{Strictness preset: \code{"lenient"}, \code{"balanced"}, \code{"strict"},
or \code{"advanced"}. Presets map to method multipliers. If not \code{"advanced"},
any manual multipliers are \strong{ignored}.}

\item{methods}{Character vector specifying which outlier detection methods
to plot: "iqr" (Interquartile Range), "median" (Median Absolute
Deviation), "mean" (Mean +/- SD), and/or "consensus".
Default is \code{c("iqr", "median", "mean", "consensus")}.
For consensus, at least two other methods must be selected.}

\item{sd_multiplier}{Width (in SD units) for the mean method
(used only when \code{strictness = "advanced"}).}

\item{mad_constant}{Constant passed to \code{stats::mad()} in advanced mode
(default 1.4826).}

\item{mad_multiplier}{Width multiplier for the MAD method (advanced mode).}

\item{iqr_multiplier}{Tukey fence multiplier for the IQR method
(advanced mode).}

\item{consensus_rule}{Number of methods that must agree (\code{1}, \code{2}, or \code{3})
for the consensus flag to call an outlier. Default \code{2}.}

\item{min_n}{Minimum observations required in the active comparison bucket
before flagging is attempted (applies to any seasonal bucket or fallback).}

\item{reporting_rate_col}{Optional column with reporting completeness in
\verb{[0, 1]}.}

\item{reporting_rate_min}{Minimum acceptable reporting rate. Rows below the
threshold receive \code{reason = "low_reporting"} and are not flagged.}

\item{key_indicators_hf}{Optional character vector of indicator names used to
determine facility activeness. If supplied, the function uses a fast path
to filter out inactive facility-months. A facility-month is considered
active if ANY of the specified key indicators have non-NA values.
Inactive facility-months are excluded from outlier detection. If \code{NULL}
(default), activeness filtering is skipped. Typical indicators include
\code{"allout"}, \code{"test"}, or \code{"conf"}. This adjustment prevents false positives
caused by facilities that start or stop reporting mid-period.}

\item{classify_outbreaks}{Logical. When \code{TRUE} (default), applies outbreak
classification to distinguish between isolated outliers and sustained
outbreak patterns. Consecutive outliers meeting the outbreak criteria are
reclassified from "outlier" to "outbreak". This is particularly useful
for epidemiological surveillance to identify disease outbreak patterns.
Set to \code{FALSE} to disable outbreak classification.}

\item{outbreak_min_run}{Integer. Minimum number of consecutive outliers
required to classify as an outbreak (default \code{2}). Must be >= 2.}

\item{outbreak_prop_tolerance}{Numeric. Proportional tolerance for outbreak
consistency (default \code{0.9}). Values within this tolerance of the run
median are considered consistent. Range: (0, 1).}

\item{outbreak_max_gap}{Integer. Maximum allowed gap (non-outlier months)
between outliers that can still be considered part of the same outbreak
(default \code{1}). For example, with \code{outbreak_max_gap = 12}, the pattern
"outlier-normal-outlier-outlier" would be classified as one outbreak
of length 3, rather than separate incidents. Set to \code{0} for strict
consecutive-only outbreaks. Useful for real-world data with reporting gaps.}

\item{show_outbreaks}{Logical. When \code{TRUE}, displays outbreaks separately
from outliers in the plot using a distinct color (#52AAC2 teal).
The subtitle will show separate counts for outliers (red) and outbreaks
(teal). When \code{FALSE} (default), outbreaks and outliers are shown
together in red. Only relevant when \code{classify_outbreaks = TRUE}.}

\item{return_plots}{Character vector specifying which plots to return.
Can be any subset of the methods being computed: "iqr", "median",
"mean", "consensus", or "all" (default). For example, if
\code{methods = c("iqr", "median", "consensus")} and
\code{return_plots = c("iqr", "consensus")}, only the IQR and consensus
plots will be returned. All computed plots are still created and
saved (if \code{plot_path} is specified), but only the requested ones
are returned.}

\item{year_breaks}{Numeric value specifying the interval for x-axis breaks.
Default \code{2}. For example, \code{2} shows every second tick and \code{3} every third.}

\item{target_language}{Character string specifying the language for plot
labels. Defaults to \code{"en"} (English). Use ISO 639-1 language codes.}

\item{source_language}{Source language code. If NULL, auto-detection is used.
Defaults to "en".}

\item{lang_cache_path}{Path to directory for storing translation cache.
Defaults to tempdir().}

\item{plot_path}{Character string specifying the path where plots should
be saved. If NULL (default), plots are not saved.}

\item{compress_image}{Logical. If TRUE, will compress the saved plot.
Defaults to FALSE}

\item{image_overwrite}{Logical. If TRUE, will overwrite existing files.
Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{compression_speed}{Integer. Speed/quality trade-off from 1
(brute-force) to 10 (fastest). Default is 1.}

\item{compression_verbose}{Logical. Controls output verbosity.
FALSE = silent, TRUE = verbose. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{plot_scale}{Numeric. Scaling factor for saved plots. Values > 1
increase size, < 1 decrease size. Default is 1.}

\item{plot_width}{Numeric. Width of saved plot in inches. If NULL (default),
width is calculated based on number of facets.}

\item{plot_height}{Numeric. Height of saved plot in inches.
If \code{NULL} (default), height is calculated from facet count.}

\item{plot_dpi}{Numeric. Resolution of saved plot in dots per inch.
Default is 300.}

\item{show_plot}{Logical. If \code{FALSE}, the plot is returned invisibly
(not displayed). Useful when only saving plots. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. When \code{TRUE}, prints an informative summary describing
methods, pooling, strictness, guardrails, and consensus rule.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
If a single method is specified, returns a ggplot object. If multiple
methods are specified, returns a named list of ggplot objects
(one per method). When \code{show_plot} is \code{FALSE}, returns invisibly.
}
\description{
This function creates plots to visualize outliers in data using the same
detection methods as \code{detect_outliers()}. Only values above the upper
thresholds are highlighted as outliers. The plotting function inherits
all parameters from the detection function for seamless integration.
}
\details{
The function creates scatter plots showing outliers detected using the
specified statistical methods. Each method produces a separate plot with
points colored by outlier status. By default, both outliers and outbreaks
are shown in red, with normal values in grey. When \code{show_outbreaks = TRUE},
outbreaks are displayed in teal (#52AAC2) to distinguish them from isolated
outliers (red). For consensus plots, the caption shows the consensus rule
used. The plots are faceted by administrative levels and include summary
statistics in the subtitle. Facet labels longer than 15 characters are
automatically truncated with "..." to prevent overcrowding.
