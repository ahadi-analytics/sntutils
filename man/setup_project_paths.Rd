\usage{
setup_project_paths(base_path = NULL, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_path}{Character path to project root. If NULL, try to detect
a root (here::here(), then rprojroot); fallback to getwd().}

\item{quiet}{Logical; suppress warning messages. Default FALSE.}
}
\value{
Named list of absolute paths:
core, admin_shp, physical_feat, hf, chw, pop_national,
pop_worldpop, cache, dhis2, pfpr_est, mortality_est, interventions,
drug_eff, climate, accessibility, land_use, dhs, ento, commodities,
val, interm, final,
val_fig, val_tbl, interm_fig, interm_tbl, final_fig, final_tbl.

\description{
Creates a list of standardized paths for the SNT pipelines
Detects a project root automatically and constructs all data/cache/output
paths with short, memorable names. Validates that folders exist and alerts
if they don't. Use initialize_project_structure() to create the folders.
}
\examples{
tmp <- tempdir()
paths <- setup_project_paths(base_path = tmp, quiet = TRUE)
paths$admin_shp
paths$val_fig
paths$interm_tbl
