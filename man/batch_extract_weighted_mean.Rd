\title{Batch Extraction of Weighted Mean from Raster Using Population Weights}
\usage{
batch_extract_weighted_mean(
  value_raster_file,
  pop_raster_file,
  shapefile,
  id_cols = c("adm0", "adm1", "adm2"),
  value_layer_to_process = 1,
  weight_na_as_zero = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{value_raster_file}{Path to the raster file containing the values to
weight (e.g., PfPR2-10)}

\item{pop_raster_file}{Path to the population raster file used for weighting}

\item{shapefile}{sf or SpatVector object of administrative boundaries}

\item{id_cols}{Character vector of administrative columns to keep}

\item{value_layer_to_process}{Integer or character. Specifies which layer in a
multi-layer raster to extract. If the raster contains multiple layers
(e.g., different years or indicators), this argument selects the layer to
be processed. Default is 1.}

\item{weight_na_as_zero}{Logical; if TRUE, treats NA weights as zero
(default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
Data frame with id_cols and population-weighted mean values
}
\description{
Computes population-weighted means of a value raster (e.g., PfPR2-10)
using a corresponding population raster as weights, across administrative
boundaries.
