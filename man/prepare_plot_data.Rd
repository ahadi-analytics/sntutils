\arguments{
\item{data}{Original data frame}

\item{x_var}{Character. Time variable (e.g. yearmon)}

\item{y_var}{Character. Optional grouping variable (e.g. district)}

\item{vars_of_interest}{Character vector of variables to analyze}

\item{by_facility}{Logical. If TRUE, compute by facility}

\item{hf_col}{Character. Name of health facility ID column (required
if by_facility)}

\item{use_reprate}{Logical. If TRUE, return reporting rate. Else, missing
rate}

\item{key_indicators}{Optional. Character vector of indicators used to define
facility activity in scenario 1. Defaults to
\code{c("allout", "conf", "test", "treat", "pres")}.}

\item{method}{Character or numeric. Classification method for facility activity
status. Can be numeric (1, 2, 3) or character ("method1", "method2", "method3").
Defaults to 3. See \code{\link{classify_facility_activity}} for details.}

\item{nonreport_window}{Integer. Minimum number of consecutive non-reporting
months to classify a facility as inactive in method 3. Defaults to 6.}

\item{reporting_rule}{Character. Defines what counts as reporting:
\code{"any_non_na"} (default, counts NA as non-reporting, 0 counts as reported)
or \code{"positive_only"} (requires >0 value to count as reported).}

\item{require_all}{Logical. When TRUE and multiple vars_of_interest are
provided, calculates the proportion of facilities reporting ALL variables
(complete data). When FALSE (default), calculates per-variable reporting
rates. Only applies to facility-level analysis (when by_facility = TRUE).}

\item{weighting}{Logical. Whether to use weighted reporting rates. When TRUE,
facilities are weighted by their typical size, giving more importance to
larger facilities in the overall reporting rate calculation. Default is FALSE.}

\item{weight_var}{Character. Name of the variable to use as proxy for
facility size (e.g., "allout" for total outpatients). Required when
weighting is TRUE. Default is NULL.}

\item{weight_window}{Integer. Number of periods for rolling window to
calculate typical facility size. Default is 12.}

\item{exclude_current_x}{Logical. Whether to exclude current period when
calculating weights. If TRUE, prevents current reporting from influencing
its own weight. Default is TRUE.}

\item{cold_start}{Character. Method for handling facilities with insufficient
history. Options: "median_within_y" (default) or "median_global".}

\description{
This function processes health facility data to prepare it for visualizing
reporting rates or missing data patterns. It supports three scenarios:
\enumerate{
\item reporting rate by time and admin unit (x + y, single var)
\item missing rate by variable over time (x only, multiple vars)
\item proportion of facilities reporting in each (x, y) group (needs hf)
}
}
