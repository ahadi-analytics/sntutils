\usage{
prepare_plot_data(
  data,
  x_var,
  y_var = NULL,
  vars_of_interest,
  by_facility = FALSE,
  hf_col = NULL,
  use_reprate = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Original data frame}

\item{x_var}{Character. Time variable (e.g. yearmon)}

\item{y_var}{Character. Optional grouping variable (e.g. district)}

\item{vars_of_interest}{Character vector of variables to analyze}

\item{by_facility}{Logical. If TRUE, compute by facility}

\item{hf_col}{Character. Name of health facility ID column (required
if by_facility)}

\item{use_reprate}{Logical. If TRUE, return reporting rate. Else, missing
rate}
}
\value{
A list with plot_data and plotting metadata
}
\description{
This function processes health facility data to prepare it for visualizing
reporting rates or missing data patterns. It supports three scenarios:
\enumerate{
\item reporting rate by time and admin unit (x + y, single var)
\item missing rate by variable over time (x only, multiple vars)
\item proportion of facilities reporting in each (x, y) group (needs hf)
}
}

# Sample data
